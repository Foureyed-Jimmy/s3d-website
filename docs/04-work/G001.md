# G001 Go Redirection 

The site `go.s3d.club` is similar to [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com).

In our implementation, we include path processing before and after map lookup.

- `/` is replaced with `__`
- `-` is replaced with `_`
- `-/` is a split point. The string following `-/` will be a path for the
  target.

The following example shows all repacements.
- `https://go.s3d.club/example-multi/level-/docs/work/G001#we-like-short-urls`

The path processing produces the following.

```javascript
{
  key: "example_multi__level",
  path: "one/two/three-four#five"
}
```  

A javascript map on the `go.s3d.club` site has a sorted map with values for the
lookup keys.

```javascript
// The following map handles our url redirections
var map = {
  changes: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/notes/changes",
  example_multi__level: "https://www.s3d.club",
  go: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/work/G001#",
  todo: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/work/todo",
	farnsw__book: specEd,
	eks: "https://www.s3d.club/docs/source/aws-eks/overview",
	hc__aws: hcAwsRes,
}
```

The example produces a redirect to this page and others. Sith the logic we have
we are able to handle a lot of URLs without having a map entry for each URL
becauase in many cases the URLs we want to redirect are in groups and as such
we can use our `-/` split point feature to have one map entry redirect to a
group of pages on another site.

## We like short URLs!
Shorter URLs are easier to read, write, remember, and share. They look better
in markdown documents and are much easier to put into code when we want to
reference something. The [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com) site is nice but for
work inside our networks and for work on professional teams we don't want the
redirect handled by an external service.
