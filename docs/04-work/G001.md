# G001 Go Redirection 

The site `go.s3d.club` is similar to [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com).

In our implementation, we include path processing before and after map lookup.

- `/` is replaced with `__`
- `-` is replaced with `_`
- `-/` is a split point. The string following `-/` will be a path for the
  target.

The following example shows all repacements.
- `https://go.s3d.club/example-multi/level-/docs/work/G001#we-like-short-urls`

The path processing produces the following.

```javascript
{
  key: "example_multi__level",
  path: "one/two/three-four#five"
}
```  

A javascript map in the code for `index.html` of the `go.s3d.club` site has a
sorted map with values for the lookup keys.

The example produces a redirect to this page.

## We like short URLs!
Shorter URLs are easier to read, write, remember, and share.
