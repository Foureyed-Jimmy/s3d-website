# Documents
The [S3D Club](/join-our-club/) is a club dedicated to sharing knowledge through written
words. In particular we aim to help people in the our comunity excel in the
field of software development. We feel what others may have seen as
disabilities in reading and/or mathematics are actually **HUGE** advantages in
both fields.

This site will eventually contain **A LOT** of words. The software development
profession is a world of documents in various programming languages. Dyslexics
excel at reading, writing. People with Dyscalculia can excel at mathematics.

The world of software development is a world of language and mathematics. We
may for example use the [Markdown](.) language to craft document formatting.
Our site runs on virtual computing resources defined in the [Terraform](.)
language.

Languages such as [C](.) and [Assembly](.) are used for working with hardware.
Our programing is documents for [hardware](.) and [software](.). The documents
here are intended for [wetwear](.) based systems. Although we may struggle with
spelling, grammer, and often find we read content multiple times dyslexics
excel when working with documents.

There is a huge range of people with dyslexia and dyscalculia. Every human on
the planet is somewhere on the spectrim of neurodiversity. Sometimes
Neurotypical are surprised to learn that Dyslexic individuals work with
programming languages. In some cases even Dyslexic people are shocked by the
idea of Dyscalculia.

This site exists for everyone on the spectrim of neurodiversity. It's possible
that you are dyslexic and don't even know it.
