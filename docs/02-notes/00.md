# Overview
Software development is a very complicated business with **A LOT** of options.

This area of the site is dedicated to sharing our **opinionated** view of how
software should be built and the approaches we recommed for using various
tools.

Software tools that are successful provide everyone, everything, supporting
every insane workflow that anyone can dream up. This is why we have hundreds of
programming languages and thousands of tools. Having strong opinions helps us
describe what we see as the right way to do things.

**GIT** is an example of a tool we love that has a lot of options. Our
opinionated view of how to use it has worked well for us. Sure, differnet
people have different views and that is fine but this is our site so we share
our opinionated views. If you think something we are recommending is wrong
headed let us know using our GitHub issues. We will either agree with you and
make a change, improve our explination and help you change, or decide that you
are an wrong and we are right.
